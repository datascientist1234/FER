"""
Functions to support the .slugignore feature.  clean_slug_dir(path) is the
main API.
There are two notable differences from the Heroku implementation:
- Velociraptor will not automatically delete repo folders like
  .git.  It will only delete things specified in .slugignore.
- Velociraptor will delete patterns specified in .slugignore *after*
  compilation is finished. (Heroku deletes before compiling.)
